        <h2>Where to find more space</h2>
        <p>When we were looking to buy a house, we visited a couple of beautiful houses for sale that turned out to be just slightly too small for our growing family. It took a bit of time to figure out which areas with housing vaguely within our price range might be a better fit.</p>
        <p>This process might have been slightly easier had we had the map below, which shows median house size by neighbourhood, with darker dots showing areas where houses are bigger on average, and lighter ones representing those with smaller houses. Its publication has been made possible by the DCLG's recent decision to publish Energy Performance Certificate data.</p>

        <p>In general, rural areas have bigger houses than urban areas. You might expect suburbs to have houses that are somewhere in between, the trade-off for a longer commute being more space to live in. And in some of the UK's largest cities this is more-or-less true.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The cramped accommodation of central Manchester gives way to spacious housing in Salford and Eccles to the west, Crumpsall to the north, Chorlton cum Hardy and Fallowfield to the south - although there is little space premium to be gained from moving east. People living in central Liverpool meanwhile, except those lucky enough to enjoy palatial lodgings in the Georgian Quarter, just south of the city centre, could benefit by moving in pretty much any direction, but most espcially by crossing the Mersey and moving to Birkenhead or Wallasey.</p>
        <p>But this pattern is not repeated everywhere. In cities like Newcastle and Plymouth the grand housing of the historic town centres is encircled by smaller houses in the outskirts.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The picture is more complex still in London, where waves of affluence and deprivation have rippled outwards from the Thames over the generations, as if constructive interference had enlarged houses in some areas but the opposite effect dampened architechtural ambitions in others.</p>
        <div class="imgRowLarge">

        </div>
        <p>The effect is vaguely reminiscent of a ringed planet, with the M25 asteroid belt providing a rough guide for housing on a scale as grand as that of the molten core of London, but mostly smaller-scale buildings to be found in between. But this already-strained analogy breaks down in north-west London, where houses barely shrink the further they are from W1, and the east end of central London, a now-wealthy but once-poor area where houses were historically built on a smaller scale.</p>
        <p>Interesting though it may be to look in isolation at the size of houses, there is a reason we haven't all moved to Mayfair. The map below shows the most expensive neighbourhoods in darker shades.</p>

        <p>Speaking as a Londoner, one disadvantage of the map above is that it is hard to distinguish between neighbourhoods in London. The colour scale for the map below has been recalibrated to make this easier.</p>
