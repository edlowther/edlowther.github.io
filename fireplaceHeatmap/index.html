        <h2>Fireplace heatmap</h2>
        <p>Which parts of London have the most open fireplaces? You've always wanted to know, and finally the <a href="https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/domestic/search">DCLG has made it possible</a> to find out!</p>
        <p>The map below shows data from all the energy performance certificates (EPCs) produced for any type of property in London in 2015. If the inspector noted at least one open fireplace, the property is marked in orange.</p>
        <p>Although homes with fireplaces are relatively common in the suburbs, in many parts of central London they have been either removed, covered up or, in the case of newer homes, were never installed - but Knightsbridge, Chelsea, Mayfair and Clapham stand out as areas where better-heeled Londoners enjoy both a short commute and a the prospect of a roaring fire upon arrival.</p>
        <p>Overall, the London neighbourhoods with the highest concentration of fireplaces are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Merton village, Wandsworth</li>
            <li>Knightsbridge and Belgravia, Westminster</li>
            <li>Alexandra, Haringay</li>
            <li>Dulwich village, Southwark</li>
            <li>Northcote, Wandsworth</li>
        </ol>
